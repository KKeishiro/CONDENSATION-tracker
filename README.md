# CONDENSATION-tracker
Object tracking with CONDENSATION tracker

# Description
**1. CONDENSATION tracker based on color histograms**

The object to be tracked is represented by the bounding box whose state is given as
```math
s = [x, y, x, y]^{T}
```
where 𝑥, 𝑦 represent the location of the center of the bounding box and 𝑥, 𝑦
represent the velocities in the 𝑥 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑦 directions. The implementation of CONDENSATION Tracker is composed of the following steps.
